Weather App

The Weather App is a modern, responsive React application that delivers real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. Designed with a clean and intuitive interface, the application includes features such as dynamic search suggestions, animated weather icons, and detailed weather metrics. Users can quickly switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit, view current atmospheric conditions, and access additional information such as humidity, wind speed, visibility, and sunrise/sunset times. The UI adapts to different weather conditions through subtle animations and a glassmorphism-inspired design.
